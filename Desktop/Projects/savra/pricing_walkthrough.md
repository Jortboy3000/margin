# Walkthrough - Pricing Page Implementation

I have successfully created a premium, standalone Pricing page for Savra.

## Changes

### [New Page] [pricing.html](file:///c:/Users/User/Desktop/Projects/savra/pricing.html)
- **Savra All-Access**: A single, powerful plan priced at **$300 / month**.
- **Hero Section**: Features high-impact typography with the "Simple, Precise Pricing." headline.
- **Pricing Card**: A centered, glassmorphism-style card detailing the core value propositions:
    - Real-time Profit Monitoring
    - 95% Accurate Cashflow Forecasting
    - Multi-business Unified Dashboard
    - Unlimited Integrations (Xero, QuickBooks)
    - AI-Driven Risk & Margin Alerts
    - Private, Encrypted Data Security
- **Value Propositions**: Three focused cards explaining the "Why behind the Price":
    - Save 20+ Hours
    - Protect Your Margin
    - Predict the Future

### [Navigation Updates]
- **index.html**: Updated header/footer "Pricing" links to `pricing.html`.
- **about.html**: Updated header/footer "Pricing" links to `pricing.html`.
- **careers.html**: Updated header/footer "Pricing" links to `pricing.html`.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Verified the "cooked" design in the browser, ensuring a high-end, precise feel.
- **Functional Check**: Confirmed all navigation links point to the new standalone page.
- **Lucide Icons**: Successfully initialized all icons for a modern look.
