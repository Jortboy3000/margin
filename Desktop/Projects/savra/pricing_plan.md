# Implementation Plan - Premium Pricing Page

Create a clean, precise, and high-impact pricing page (`pricing.html`) for Savra.

## Proposed Changes

### [New Page] [pricing.html](file:///c:/Users/User/Desktop/Projects/savra/pricing.html)
- **Header/Footer**: Reuse the standardized header (without theme toggle) and footer from `about.html`.
- **Hero Section**:
    - Headline: "Simple, Predictable Pricing."
    - Subheadline: "No hidden fees. No tiers. Just pure intelligence for your business."
- **Pricing Card**:
    - Price: "$300 / mo" (Introductory Rate)
    - Focus: One single, All-Access plan for founders.
    - Plan Name: "Savra All-Access"
    - Features:
        - Real-time Profit Monitoring
        - Cashflow Forecasting (95% accuracy)
        - Multi-business Unified Dashboard
        - 50+ Integrations (Xero, QuickBooks, etc.)
        - AI-Driven Risk Alerts
        - Private Data Encryption
- **Comparison/Value Section**: Reiterate the value of saving hours on spreadsheets vs. the $300 monthly investment.
- **Enterprise Option**: Add a secondary, subtle card or text for Enterprise needs (Custom pricing for 5+ entities, customized workflows, dedicated support).
- **CTA**: "Book your Demo Today" linking to `signup.html`.

### [Navigation Updates]
- Update the navigation links in `index.html`, `about.html`, and `careers.html` to point to the new `pricing.html`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests (Browser)
- Open `pricing.html`.
- Verify the pricing card displays $300/mo correctly.
- Verify all navigational links to and from the pricing page work.
- Verify responsiveness on mobile.

### Manual Verification
- Visual check of the "Cooked" design: ensure it feels premium with subtle animations and correct lighting.
- Ensure the contrast is high and the "clean and precise" requirement is met.
